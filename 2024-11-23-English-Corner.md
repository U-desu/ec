##### Topic Introduction
Many people are too preoccupied with worldly standards and material realities to realize that their hearts and talents are different, and may grow older before realizing the importance of pursuing individualized interests and spiritual pursuits.

很多人过于讲究世俗标准和物质现实而忽略了自己的内心和天赋不同，可能年纪渐长后才知道寻求个性化兴趣和精神追求的重要性。
