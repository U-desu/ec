##### Topic Introduction
In any relationship, balancing individuality and shared identity can be challenging. While every single person come with their own values, interests, and identities, they often blend into a collective identity. This is especially true when interests overlap, which can either strengthen the bond or cause tension.

Maintaining individuality is vital because it allows each person to grow and pursue personal passions. However, a shared identity is also important, creating unity and mutual support. The challenge lies in finding a balance between these two, where everyone can pursue their interests without feeling overshadowed or competing for recognition. In this session, we’ll explore how relationships can nurture both individuality and a shared sense of identity while maintaining a healthy balance.

在任何关系中，平衡个性和共同身份都是一项挑战。虽然每个人都有自己的价值观、兴趣和身份，但它们往往会融合成一种集体身份。当兴趣爱好重叠时尤其如此，这既可能加强彼此的联系，也可能导致关系紧张。
保持个性至关重要，因为这可以让每个人成长并追求个人激情。然而，共同的身份认同也很重要，它能创造团结和相互支持。挑战在于如何在这两者之间找到平衡，让每个人都能追求自己的兴趣，而不会感到被忽视或争夺认可。在本节课中，我们将探讨如何在人际关系中培养个性和共同的认同感，同时保持健康的平衡。
