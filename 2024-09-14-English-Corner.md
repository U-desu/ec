## Topic: Things that drain your energy or make you feel accomplished
### Host: Jason

## Topic Overview

With the release of the phenomenal Black Myth: Wu Kong, which has taken the world by storm, I can't help but think back to those days when I used to go on a game-buying spree on Steam: as soon as I saw a big discount, I'd buy the game and enshrine it in my repository, whether it was for me or not. Every time I opened the game with anticipation, I swear I did everything I could to get immersed in it, but after the initial excitement, to the lull, and finally to the struggle, I shut it down for good. So this time I didn't order it, even though I knew it was an extremely good game.

In fact, single player games are a drain for me. If it brings me joy or achievement, expending some energy is actually totally worth it. The problem is that repeated experience has taught me that the joy and fulfillment I get from a game is completely disproportionate to the amount of energy expended.

On the other hand, it takes energy to communicate with different people in other languages, but I get plenty of joy and fulfillment. Being alone consumes the least amount of energy, but making good use of that alone time can also result in great feedback.

## Self-introduction Part

### Intro Yourself
Kick off by introducing yourself. Share anything about yourself as long as you feel comfortable.

### Share a Recent Interesting/Happy or Anxious/Unhappy Incident
Let's get personal! Tell us about something exciting or joyful that happened to you recently. Alternatively, if you're comfortable, share a moment that made you feel anxious or unhappy. It's all about connection and understanding each other better.

## Discussion Part

1. **What do you think is the thing that consumes you the most, physically or mentally?**
2. **Do you think this has anything to do with the MBTI or astrology?**
3. **What are some of the things that you feel give you a sense of fulfillment and how does it affect your work and life? Is there anything that can be extended?**

Remember, our goal is to create an engaging and inclusive environment where everyone feels comfortable sharing their thoughts and experiences.

Let's encourage open dialogue and active listening to make this English Corner a memorable one!
