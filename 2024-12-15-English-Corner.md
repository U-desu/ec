##### Topic Introduction
The past years have been a period of remarkable changes and challenges both in China and across the world. From 2022 to 2024, we have witnessed significant global events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and its recovery phase, advancements in artificial intelligence, and efforts to address climate change. In China, rapid technological progress and initiatives like rural revitalization and green development have shaped our lives profoundly.

On a personal level, these years may have brought changes to your career, studies, or relationships. Perhaps you've learned new skills, faced unexpected obstacles, or achieved important milestones. Reflecting on this period helps us appreciate our growth and better understand how we've adapted to a changing world.

Let’s discuss and share how the past years have influenced us, our communities, and the world around us.

过去几年，中国和世界都发生了显著的变化，也面临着巨大的挑战。从 2022 年到 2024 年，我们见证了 COVID-19 大流行及其恢复阶段、人工智能的进步以及应对气候变化的努力等全球重大事件。在中国，科技进步日新月异，乡村振兴、绿色发展等举措深刻影响着我们的生活。

就个人而言，这些年可能给你的职业、学习或人际关系带来了变化。也许你学到了新的技能，遇到了意想不到的障碍，或者实现了重要的里程碑。反思这段时期有助于我们欣赏自己的成长，更好地了解自己是如何适应这个不断变化的世界的。
