#### Host: Jason

##### Topic Introduction
In a team setting, it's common to start with high energy, enthusiasm, and clear goals. But as time passes, some members may lose motivation, and the once vibrant energy of the group can dissipate. This phenomenon, often referred to as "energy dissipation," can leave one person carrying the bulk of responsibilities, leading to frustration and burnout.

Why does this happen? How can we prevent it, or reignite the team spirit when it starts to fade? And what should we do when facing a team where commitment seems unbalanced? Today, let’s discuss and explore our own experiences with this challenge, and share strategies to keep the team moving forward cohesively.
