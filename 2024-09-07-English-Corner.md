## Topic: Recalling the subtle Mid-Autumn Festival
### Host: Secret

## Topic Overview

The Mid-Autumn Festival holds some significance for me. 

Firstly, it falls near my birthday. I rarely celebrate my birthday, but because of the Mid-Autumn Festival, my aunt or mom usually mentions it and might even give me some money. ü§¶‚Äç

Additionally, the Mid-Autumn Festival is a time for family reunions, and it also takes place in mid-autumn, a season when leaves fall from the trees and the temperature begins to drop. This gives it a sense of farewell as well. 

Moreover, there are many classic poems that describe the full moon, reflecting the poets' feelings of loneliness. 

So, let's talk about past memories and take a deep breath to feel them in our hearts.

## Self-introduction Part

### Intro Yourself
Kick off by introducing yourself. Share anything about yourself as long as you feel comfortable.

### Share a Recent Interesting/Happy or Anxious/Unhappy Incident
Let's get personal! Tell us about something exciting or joyful that happened to you recently. Alternatively, if you're comfortable, share a moment that made you feel anxious or unhappy. It's all about connection and understanding each other better.

## Discussion Part

1. **Would you mind sharing your zodiac sign first and talking about your most memorable birthdays?**

3. **Why are the rituals of festivals disappearing?**
4. **Is there anyone you really want to see again?**
5. **Which moment makes you feel like time is passing by?**
