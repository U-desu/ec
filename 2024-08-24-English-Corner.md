## Topic Overview

Hey gus, welcome to our English Corner~

This week, we're exploring "The Special Place in Your Heart." We all have places that hold unique significance for us, and today we invite you to share yours.

This special place could be anything - a breathtaking sunset glimpsed during your travels, the first ray of sunlight on a sea of clouds at dawn, or your grandmother's small courtyard. There are no limitations; it can be any place that holds a distinctive spot in your heart.

## Self-introduction Part

### Intro Yourself
Kick off by introducing yourself. Share anything about yourself as long as you feel comfortable.

### Share a Recent Interesting/Happy or Anxious/Unhappy Incident
Let's get personal! Tell us about something exciting or joyful that happened to you recently. Alternatively, if you're comfortable, share a moment that made you feel anxious or unhappy. It's all about connection and understanding each other better.

## Discussion Part

1. **Think of a place that holds a special place in your heart.**
  - It could be anywhere - a travel destination, your hometown, or a relative's house.
  - It's the place that comes to mind when you see the question in your mind

2. **What's your earliest or most vivid memory associated with this place? Can you share a specific moment or experience?**
  - Try to recall the sights, sounds, smells, or emotions you experienced.
  - Don't worry if the memory isn't perfectly clear; share what stands out to you.

3. **If you could return to this place, what would you like to do or see that you missed the first time? Or, if you've been back, how was the experience different?**
  - Consider something you missed last time that you'd love to see, or an experience you'd want to relive in a different way.
  - Reflect on how your perspective might change now that you've already been there.

Remember, our goal is to create an engaging and inclusive environment where everyone feels comfortable sharing their thoughts and experiences.

Let's encourage open dialogue and active listening to make this English Corner a memorable one!
