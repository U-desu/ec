## Topic Overview

Welcome to our English Corner. This week, we have a very intriguing topic that touches each one of us in different ways – it's all about relationships between men and women. Relationships are a fundamental part of our lives; they shape our experiences, our emotions, and our personal growth.

Whether you're single, dating, or married, your insights and experiences are valuable. So, let's share our thoughts on the dynamics of these relationships and learn from each other. Remember, there's no right nor wrong answer here; we're here to exchange perspectives in a friendly and respectful manner.

## Self-introduction Part

### Intro Yourself
Kick off by introducing yourself. Share anything about yourself as long as you feel comfortable.

### Share a Recent Interesting/Happy or Anxious/Unhappy Incident
Let's get personal! Tell us about something exciting or joyful that happened to you recently. Alternatively, if you're comfortable, share a moment that made you feel anxious or unhappy. It's all about connection and understanding each other better.

## Discussion Part

1. **Think of a place that holds a special place in your heart.**
    - It could be anywhere - a travel destination, your hometown, or a relative's house.
    - It's the place that comes to mind when you see the question in your mind

2. **What's your earliest or most vivid memory associated with this place? Can you share a specific moment or experience?**
    - Try to recall the sights, sounds, smells, or emotions you experienced.
    - Don't worry if the memory isn't perfectly clear; share what stands out to you.

3. **If you could return to this place, what would you like to do or see that you missed the first time? Or, if you've been back, how was the experience different?**
    - Consider something you missed last time that you'd love to see, or an experience you'd want to relive in a different way.
    - Reflect on how your perspective might change now that you've already been there.
