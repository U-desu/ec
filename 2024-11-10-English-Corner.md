##### Topic Introduction
Double Eleven (November 11th) as “Bachelor's Day” originated from Chinese campus culture. Around the late 1990s and early 2000s, this date was gradually teased as “Singles' Day” because the “four ones” symbolized “singles”, and it was especially popular among college students. It is especially popular among college students. Without the participation of e-commerce platforms, Double Eleven was not as commercial as it is today, but more of a social and entertainment festival.
At that time, most of the topics on the Internet centered on the single life of gossip, paragraphs, spoof pictures, and even some informal gatherings and offline activities to alleviate the “loneliness” of singles. In many campus or youth forums, people will discuss how to “get rid of singles” or encourage each other to organize some “bachelor parties”. Of course, there are all kinds of creative confessions and self-deprecating posts, and the atmosphere is relatively light and humorous.
After the rise of social media, especially in forums and early QQ space, posting bar and other platforms, double eleven has also become a topic gathering point for single netizens. We share the “single daily life” through funny paragraphs and graphics, and also jokingly call themselves “bachelors”, and sometimes launch the “challenge to get rid of singles”, forming a kind of mutual teasing The “bachelor culture” has formed a kind of mutual flirtation.
Until 2009, when Alibaba held Double Eleven as a shopping festival for the first time, the day gradually evolved into a festival for all people to shop, and the nature of the original “bachelor's day” was gradually diluted. However, for the old generation of netizens, Double Eleven still has some emotional nostalgia, and sometimes they will flirt with the culture of “bachelor's day” on social platforms.

双十一（11月11日）作为“光棍节”起源于中国校园文化。大约在上世纪90年代末和2000年代初，这个日期因为“四个一”象征了“单身”而逐渐被大家当作“单身节”来调侃，尤其在大学生群体中很受欢迎。没有电商平台参与时，双十一并不具备如今的商业色彩，而是更像一个社交和娱乐的节日。
那时的双十一，网络上的话题大多围绕单身生活的吐槽、段子、恶搞图片，甚至会有一些非正式的聚会和线下活动，来缓解单身的“寂寞感”。许多校园或年轻人的论坛上，大家会讨论如何“脱单”或互相鼓励，组织一些“单身派对”。当然，少不了的是各种创意的表白和自嘲的帖子，气氛比较轻松幽默。
在社交媒体兴起后，尤其是论坛和早期的QQ空间、贴吧等平台上，双十一还成为了单身网友们的一个话题聚集点。大家通过搞笑段子、图文来分享“单身日常”，也会戏称自己是“光棍”，有时还会发起“脱单挑战”，形成一种互相调侃的“光棍文化”。
直到2009年阿里巴巴首次把双十一作为购物节举办，这一天才逐渐演变成全民购物的节日，原有的“光棍节”性质被逐渐淡化。不过对于老一代网民来说，双十一依旧留有一些情感上的怀旧意味，有时也会在社交平台上调侃起当年的“光棍节”文化。
